# LSTNR
Python webserver that receives shell connections from remote devices. 

Remote devices can be managed from a Command Line Interface (CLI)

Remote devices can be managed from the DeathStar webpage.

# DISCLAIMER
This is only for testing purposes, not intended for anything illegal. I was testing out ways to manage multiple connections while doing the OSCP labs. #Hobbies
